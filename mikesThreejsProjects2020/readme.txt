Run run1.html in Chrome browser. In the text field at the top,
enter the name of your Javascript file (ending in .js) and 
click Run or press return.

There are projects to do at the top of these files:
    triangle.js
    starburst.js
    cubeMatrix.js
    spinningCylinders.js and spinningSpheres.js

Don't touch these files. Copy them to similarly named files;
eg. copy triangle.js to triangle2.js and modify the latter file.
If you mangle a file, there's an extra copy of it.

There are no right or wrong answers here! The idea is to change different
values and to write a bit of code and to see what pictures you get. 
The idea is to experiment and to have fun!
